# Live JSON

An interactive tool to visualize JSON payloads. Want to iterate quickly on that API, well this tool allows you to post that payload directly on the flow
with out having to stop to copy paste here and there, just leave the tab open and keep the beats going.



## Roadmap
- [] Home page
- [] Live JSON viewer
- [] Session intro page
- [] Interpolate payloads to `zod` parsers
- [] Password protect sessions
